Seun Onile-ere (29/05/17) Task 3: Fireside_Fixture_Manager

This program is being created so that leaderboard fixtures may be be determined for each player attempting to enter the Fireside Annual Card Gaming Leauge, sourcing these inputted fixtures played/results from the relevant files holding the fixture data.
